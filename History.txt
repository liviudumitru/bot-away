=== 1.1.0 2010-06-21
* Minor enhancements:
  * ActionController::Request.accepts_unfiltered_params is now accessible as BotAway.accepts_unfiltered_params
  * BotAway.show_honeypots = true will show honeypots as visible elements within the form, for debugging.
  * BotAway.dump_params = true will dump the params hash as it was before BotAway modified it, for debugging.
  * BotAway will no longer generate hashes for, or disguise, elements whose names have been added to
    BotAway.unfiltered_params. This should resolve issues where JavaScript is involved (case in point:
    Calendar Date Select).
* Bugfix:
  * Resolved: Unfiltered params were not matched if they were of differing types (ie Symbol vs String). This caused
    problems in particular with Calendar Date Select.
    
=== 1.0.3 2010-06-13
* Bugfixes:
  * Resolved: On or before Rails 2.3.8, honeypots were generated as escaped HTML. This was because Rails started
    using ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer to generate the content, and Bot-Away did not. (It does now.)

=== 1.0.2 2010-04-02
* Bugfixes:
  * Resolved: Would sometimes generate honeypot tabindex of 0 instead of -1, interfering with keyboard operations

=== 1.0.1 2010-04-02
* 2 minor enhancements:
  * ActionController::Request.accepts_unfiltered_params creates an array of params that will not be checked
  * Took all honeypots out of the keyboard tab order using randomized negative indexes.

* Bugfixes:
  * Empty select tags no longer raise errors

=== 0.0.1 2010-03-24

* 1 major enhancement:
  * Initial release
